INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running

http://localhost:8080/jenkins/
Browser is okay to display Jenkins UI
If click People, http://localhost:8080/jenkins/asynchPeople/, there is no user there. This is confirmed that it is different from standard jenkins started from tomcat.

Changing port
If you need to launch the Jenkins on a different port than 8080, set the port through the system property jetty.port.
mvn hpi:run -Djetty.port=8090

Distributing a Plugin
    To create a distribution image of your plugin, run the following Maven command:

$ mvn package
    This should create target/*.hpi file. Other users can use Jenkins' web UI to upload this plugin to Jenkins (or place it in $JENKINS_HOME/plugins.)
    Releasing a Plugin and Hosting a Plugin on jenkins-ci.org

# ==============================================================================
# Install a plugin
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/
1) copy jpi/hpi file unde $JENKINS_HOME/plugins folder
2) Manually install from Jenkins Web UI , Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Advanced tab > Scroll Down to File Upload section
3) Run Jenkins CLI commands
       java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ install-plugin SOURCE ... [-deploy] [-name VAL] [-restart]
       java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ install-plugin ~/.jenkins/plugins/subversion.jpi
	    java.io.IOException: There's no Jenkins running at http://localhost:8080/

       cd ~/workspace/jenkins/sji-plugin/target/tmp/webapp/WEB-INF
       java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/jenkins install-plugin ~/.jenkins/plugins/subversion.jpi
       WARNING: CLI authentication failure
       [WARN] Failed to authenticate with your SSH keys. Proceeding as anonymous
       Installing a plugin from local file: ~/.jenkins/plugins/subversion.jpi

       subversion.jpi was uploaded to ~/workspace/jenkins/sji-plugin/work/plugins, but not expanded

   jenkins-cli.jar can be found under 
	~/workspace/jenkins/sji-plugin/target/tmp/webapp/WEB-INF or
	~/j01/srv/tomcat/webapps/jenkins/WEB-INF
# ==============================================================================

tomcat - jenkins - ~/.jenkins/plugins
jettey - jenkins - ~/workspace/jenkins/mw-plugin/work/plugins
    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000,suspend=n"
    mvn hpi:run
    Jenkins home directory: ~/workspace/jenkins/mw-plugin/work found at: SystemProperties.getProperty("JENKINS_HOME")
exercise:
cp ~/.jenkins/plugins/git.jpi ~/workspace/jenkins/mw-plugin/work
cd ~/workspace/jenkins/mw-plugin
mvn hpi:plugin
verified that a new folder git/ was created under ~/workspace/jenkins/mw-plugin/work/plugins
basically, git.jpi was unzipped after jettey server started

jon-dell5050 $ ls | wc
     57      57    1035
jon-dell5050 $ ls -al | wc
     60     533    4119
Now install gitserver.jpi manually from jetty jenkins instance

# ==============================================================================
# Remove a plugin
1) From Web UI, Sign in as Administrator, Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Installed tab
   Select a plugin, e.g. git-client, to be uninstalled. Restart if necessary to take effective
   Notice that git-client.jpi was removed from $JENKINS_HOME/plugins, but exploded git-client
   folder remained
2) shutdown Jenkins, go to $JENKINS_HOME/plugins folder, manually removed xxx.jpi files and its 
   exploded folder, this is not recommended since its dependencies are not removed.
